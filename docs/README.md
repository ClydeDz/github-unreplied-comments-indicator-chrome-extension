# GitHub Unreplied Comments Indicator

Highlights GitHub pull request comments with no replies, helping you spot unresolved feedback instantly.

## What and why?

This extension helps you stay on top of pull request reviews by visually highlighting GitHub comments that havenâ€™t received a reply. Unreplied comments remain marked until another comment is added to the thread, ensuring you never miss important feedback or leave questions unanswered. Perfect for developers who want to keep PR discussions tidy and ensure all reviewer notes are addressed.
